# Hi there! I'm Kammy!

Check out my website: https://leafia.eu/

> [!WARNING]  
> Some of my archived projects are (contrary to what the update date is telling you) super old and not guaranteed to be functional. The source code remains available either way.

## Open-source software policy

Because of the rise of large language models and the use of public source code to train AI models, I have decided to stop making open-source software. This is because I do not work on my free time only for major tech companies to take my code without crediting me and using it to train AI models.

* Projects I am currently working on will be closed-source, unless they date from before I made this decision, in which case they will remain open-source.
* Projects I have abandoned will be released as open-source under the GNU AGPLv3 license (like before) 30 days after they are abandoned.

### Projects getting a source release soon soon

* Luxicon: September 20th, 2025
